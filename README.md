# 🚦 AI-Based Urban Traffic Prediction & Visualization System

This project is a smart city–oriented web application that predicts and visualizes urban traffic congestion using AI-based logic and real-time simulation.

The system classifies traffic into **Low, Medium, and High congestion levels** based on traffic density, average speed, and weather conditions, and visualizes the results using maps, heatmaps, road color indicators, and charts.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion causes delays, pollution, and safety issues. Traditional traffic monitoring systems lack real-time visualization and predictive insights. There is a need for an intelligent system to predict and visualize traffic conditions effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict traffic congestion level (Low / Medium / High)
- Visualize traffic using maps and heatmaps
- Simulate real-time traffic data
- Display analytics using bar and line charts
- Provide a clean and user-friendly dashboard for smart city applications

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Visualization:** Leaflet.js, Leaflet Heatmap  
- **Charts:** Chart.js  
- **Backend (Optional):** Python, Flask  
- **Concepts Used:** AI logic, traffic flow parameters, real-time simulation

---

## ✨ Features
- Manual traffic prediction using user inputs
- Real-time traffic data simulation (auto-update every 10 seconds)
- Free map-based traffic visualization
- Heatmap showing congestion intensity
- Road color indicators:
  - 🟢 Green – Low congestion  
  - 🔵 Blue – Medium congestion  
  - 🔴 Red – High congestion  
- Bar chart showing congestion probability
- Line chart showing future traffic trend (15 / 30 / 60 minutes)
- Dark mode enabled dashboard
- Traffic statistics (Last updated, Today traffic, Previous week average)

---

## 🗺️ Traffic Visualization
- Roads dynamically change color based on predicted congestion
- Heatmap highlights high-density traffic areas
- Interactive map for better understanding of traffic flow

---

## 📊 Data Analytics
- **Bar Chart:** Distribution of congestion probability
- **Line Chart:** Future traffic trend prediction
- **Statistics Panel:** Real-time traffic insights
